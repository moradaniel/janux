<h1>Of servlet mappings, springmvc RequestMappings and Views, and GET requests</h1>
<p>Went through Colin Sampaleanu's tutorial at:</p>

</p><p>
This involves a very basic/minimal web.xml, a basic annotated controller with a single method which
returns a full path to a view at 'WEB-INF/view/test/index.jsp', and a minimal default annotation driven
configuration.
</p><p>
I ran into various unexpected behaviors, chiefly because I was trying to vary the web.xml
DispatcherServlet mapping, the RequestMapping in the controller, the view, and the GET request.  The
table below illustrates the various use cases and the resulting behavior.
</p>
<p>The sample app was deployed at localhost/mvc or /mvc in short.</p>
<p>The controller is called BasicController</p>
<p>The view returned by the controller was either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>relative: "WEB-INF/view/test/index.jsp", or</li>
	<li>absolute: "/WEB-INF/view/test/index.jsp"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<p>
I had initially included an old-style org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener and this
was causing the default InternalResourceView to disappear, thus not being able to serve the view at
WEB-INF/view/test/index.jsp.
</p>

<p>
Also, although the Dispatcher Servlet is mapped to '/', adding an 'index.jsp' file in the root of
the webapp folder causes this page to be served and the DispatcherServlet to be ignored.
