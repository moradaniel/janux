<!--
THIS SCRIPT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH ANTHILL ON A UNIX MACHINE.

The <exec> will not work on a windows machine. To make it work,
you must change executable to "maven.bat".

I have tried to make this compatible with Windows by using
the <exec os=""> tag, which seemed to break things.

Again, this script was written to be used to wrap a maven call
within an ant build script for the Anthill system.

If you are trying to build, try the following commands:

maven java:compile
maven jar
maven war
-->
  <target name="compile">
  <javac srcdir="./src" destdir="./bin" debug="on" optimize="off">
    <classpath>
      <fileset dir="lib" includes="*.jar"/>
    </classpath>
  </javac>
</target>
