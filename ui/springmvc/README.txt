This project was originally created to integrate springmvc, tiles and
velocity/freemarker.  It is provided here for reference only.

This integration now exists out of the box in Tiles2 and in the latest springmvc release
(3.0.3), and, as such, this project will eventually be deprecated.

Note that the spring version for this project is overriden to 2.5.6 which is the
last spring version with which this project is known to run in its current
implementation.
